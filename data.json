Near the edge of the region's massive molecular cloud some 2,400 light-years away, bright reddish emission region Sharpless (Sh) 155 is at the center of the frame, also known as the Cave Nebula. About 10 light-years across the cosmic cave's bright walls of gas are ionized by ultraviolet light from the hot young stars around it. Dusty reflection nebulae, like vdB 155 to the right, and dense obscuring clouds of dust also abound on the interstellar canvas. Astronomical explorations have revealed other dramatic signs of star formation, including the bright reddish fleck of Herbig-Haro (HH) 168. Below and right of center, the Herbig-Haro object emission is generated by energetic jets from a newborn star.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2211/Cave_Copyright_APOD.png","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Light, the Dark, and the Dusty","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2211/Cave_Copyright_APOD1024.png"}
