Sharp telescopic views like this one reveal the spectacular cluster's hundreds of thousands of stars. At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the cluster stars crowd into a region 150 light-years in diameter. Approaching the cluster core upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the closest star to the Sun is over 4 light-years away. The remarkable range of brightness recorded in this image follows stars into the dense cluster core. Distant background galaxies in the medium-wide field of view include NGC 6207 at the lower right.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2105/M13_FA12STXL11002_LRGB_2021-05.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M13: The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2105/M13_FA12STXL11002_LRGB_2021-05_1024.jpg"}
