{"date":"2022-02-06","explanation":"Welcome to planet Earth, the third planet from a star named the Sun.  The Earth is shaped like a sphere and composed mostly of rock.  Over 70 percent of the Earth's surface is water.  The planet has a relatively thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen and oxygen.  The featured picture of Earth, dubbed The Blue Marble, was taken from Apollo 17 in 1972 and features Africa and Antarctica.  It is thought to be one of the most widely distributed photographs of any kind.  Earth has a single large Moon that is about 1/4 of its diameter and, from the planet's surface, is seen to have almost exactly the same angular size as the Sun.  With its abundance of liquid water, Earth supports a large variety of life forms, including potentially intelligent species such as dolphins and humans.  Please enjoy your stay on planet Earth.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2202/bluemarble_apollo17_3000.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Blue Marble Earth","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2202/bluemarble_apollo17_960.jpg"}
