One of most spectacular times this occurred was about 30 years ago when the Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft zoomed past our home planetary system.  Then, robotic Galileo watched from about 15-times the Earth-Moon separation as our only natural satellite glided past our home world.  The featured video combines 52 historic color-enhanced images. Although our Moon may appear small next to the Earth, no other planet in our Solar System has a satellite so comparable in size .
