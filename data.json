In this version of the image the colors look bizarre. Still, an intriguing optical illusion known as an afterimage can help you experience the same scene with a more natural looking appearance. To try it, find the sunspots of active region AR4079 grouped near the bottom of the blue solar disk. Relax and stare at the dark sunspot group for about 30 seconds, then close your eyes or shift your gaze to a plain white surface. In a moment an afterimage of the sunset should faintly appear. But the afterimage sunset will have this image's complementary colors and a more normal yellow Sun against a familiar blue sky.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Afterimageorizontal.jpeg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Afterimage Sunset","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Afterimageorizontalcrop.jpeg"}
