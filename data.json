For northern hemisphere dwellers that's a traditional name of the full moon nearest the September equinox. Seen from Saunderstown, Rhode Island, planet Earth, this Harvest Moon left a broad streak of warm hues as it rose through a twilight sky over the Newport Bridge. On September 20 its trail was captured in a single 22 minute exposure using a dense filter and a digital camera. Only two days later the September equinox marked a change of season and the beginning of autumn in the north. In fact, recognizing a season as the time between solstice and equinox, this Harvest Moon was the fourth full moon of the season, coming just before the astronomical end of northern summer.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2109/Cohea_APOD_HarvestMoon.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Harvest Moon Trail","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2109/Cohea_APOD_HarvestMoon1067.jpg"}
