{"copyright":"Simone Curzi","date":"2024-10-31","explanation":"By starlight, this eerie visage shines in the dark with a crooked profile evoking its popular name, the Witch Head Nebula. In fact, this entrancing telescopic portrait gives the impression that a witch has fixed her gaze on Orion's bright supergiant star Rigel. More formally known as IC 2118, the Witch Head Nebula spans about 50 light-years and is composed of interstellar dust grains reflecting Rigel's starlight. The color of the Witch Head Nebula is caused not only by Rigel's intense blue light, but because the dust grains scatter blue light more efficiently than red. The same physical process causes Earth's daytime sky to appear blue, although the scatterers in Earth's atmosphere are molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. Rigel and this dusty cosmic crone are about 800 light-years away. You may still see a few witches in your neighborhood tonight though, so have a safe and Happy Halloween!","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2410/Strega_apod_3.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Rigel and the Witch Head Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2410/Strega_apod_1024r.jpg"}
