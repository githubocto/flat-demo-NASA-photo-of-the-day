C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS) is currently moving out from inside the orbit of Venus and on track to pass its nearest to the Earth in about two weeks.  Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, pronounced \"Choo-cheen-shahn At-less,\", is near naked-eye visibility and easily picked up by long-exposure cameras.  The comet can also now be found by observers in Earth's northern hemisphere as well as the south.  The featured image was captured just a few days ago above Zacatecas, Mexico. Because clouds were obscuring much of the pre-dawn sky, the astrophotographer released a drone to take pictures from higher up, several of which were later merged to enhance the comet's visibility. Although the future brightness of comets is hard to predict, there is increasing hope that Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS will further brighten as it enters the early evening sky.
