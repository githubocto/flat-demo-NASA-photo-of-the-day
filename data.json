{"date":"2021-10-11","explanation":"What would it be like to fly over the largest moon in the Solar System? In June, the robotic Juno spacecraft flew past Jupiter's huge moon Ganymede and took images that have been digitally constructed into a detailed flyby. As the featured video begins, Juno swoops over the two-toned surface of the 2,000-km wide moon, revealing an icy alien landscape\u00a0filled with grooves and craters. The grooves are likely caused by shifting surface plates, while the craters are caused by violent impacts. Continuing on in its orbit, Juno then performed its\u00a034th close pass over Jupiter's clouds. The digitally-constructed video shows numerous swirling clouds in the north, colorful planet-circling zones and bands across the middle -- featuring several white-oval clouds from the String of Pearls, and finally more swirling clouds in the south.  Next September, Juno is scheduled to make a close pass over another of Jupiter's large moons: Europa.","media_type":"video","service_version":"v1","title":"Juno Flyby of Ganymede and Jupiter","url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CC7OJ7gFLvE?rel=0"}
