{"date":"2025-11-30","explanation":"If you could stand on Titan -- what would you see? The featured color view from Titan gazes across an unfamiliar and distant landscape on Saturn's largest moon.  The scene was recorded by ESA's Huygens probe in 2005 after a 2.5-hour descent through a thick atmosphere of nitrogen laced with methane.  Bathed in an eerie orange light at ground level, rocks strewn about the scene could well be composed of water and hydrocarbons frozen solid at an inhospitable temperature of negative 179 degrees C.  The large light-toned rock below and left of center is only about 15 centimeters across and lies 85 centimeters away.  The saucer-shaped spacecraft is believed to have penetrated about 15 centimeters into a place on Titan's surface that had the consistency of wet sand or clay.  Huygen's batteries enabled the probe to take and transmit data for more than 90 minutes after landing.  Titan's bizarre chemical environment may bear similarities to planet Earth's before life evolved.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/Titan_Huygens_960.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Surface of Titan from Huygens","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/Titan_Huygens_960.jpg"}
