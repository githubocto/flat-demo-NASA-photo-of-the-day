Taken on July 24, the 3D color view is from the Mars Ingenuity Helicopter's 10th flight above the Red Planet. Two images from Ingenuity's color camera, both captured at an altitude of 12 meters (40 feet), but a few meters apart to provide a stereo perspective, were used to construct the color anaglyph. Ingenuity's stereo images were made at the request of the Mars Perseverance rover science team. The team is considering a visit to these raised ridges on the floor of Jezero Crater during Perseverance's first science campaign.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2108/PIA24688_RTE_Anaglyph.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Jezero Crater: Raised Ridges in 3D","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2108/PIA24688_RTE_Anaglyph1024.jpg"}
