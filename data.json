{"date":"2021-04-19","explanation":"What does the center of our galaxy look like?  In visible light, the Milky Way's center is hidden by clouds of obscuring dust and gas. But in this stunning vista, the Spitzer Space Telescope's infrared cameras, penetrate much of the dust revealing the stars of the crowded galactic center region. A mosaic of many smaller snapshots, the detailed, false-color image shows older, cool stars in bluish hues. Red and brown glowing dust clouds are associated with young, hot stars in stellar nurseries. The very center of the Milky Way has recently been found capable of forming newborn stars. The galactic center lies some 26,700 light-years away, toward the constellation Sagittarius. At that distance, this picture spans about 900 light-years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2104/GalacticCore_SpitzerSchmidt_6143.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Galactic Center in Infrared","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2104/GalacticCore_SpitzerSchmidt_960.jpg"}
