{"copyright":"Lorand Fenyes","date":"2021-09-25","explanation":"To the eye, this cosmic composition nicely balances the Bubble Nebula at the right with open star cluster M52. The pair would be lopsided on other scales, though. Embedded in a complex of interstellar dust and gas and blown by the winds from a single, massive O-type star, the Bubble Nebula, also known as NGC 7635, is a mere 10 light-years wide.  On the other hand, M52 is a rich open cluster of around a thousand stars. The cluster is about 25 light-years across. Seen toward the northern boundary of Cassiopeia, distance estimates for the Bubble Nebula and associated cloud complex are around 11,000 light-years, while star cluster M52 lies nearly 5,000 light-years away. The wide telescopic field of view spans about 1.5 degrees on the sky or three times the apparent size of a full Moon.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2109/241_lorand_fenyes_bubble_m52.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Bubble and the Star Cluster","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2109/241_lorand_fenyes_bubble_m52_1120.jpg"}
